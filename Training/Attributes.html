<!--Bullet Points
All HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about elements
Attributes are always specified in the start tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value" -->

The href Attribute:
The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to:
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a>

The src Attribute:
The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page.
The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed:
<img src="img_girl.jpg">

There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:

1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. 
Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".

2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. 
If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg".
If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".

The width and height Attributes:
The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes,
which specify the width and height of the image (in pixels):
Example:<img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600">

The alt Attribute:
The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image,
if the image for some reason cannot be displayed.
This can be due to a slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.
Example:<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket">

The style Attribute:
The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.
Example:<p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>

The lang Attribute:
You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page.
This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.
Example:<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<body>
...
</body>
</html>

The title Attribute:
The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.
The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element:
Example:<p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p>

Always Quote Attribute Values:

Good:
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">Visit our HTML tutorial</a>
Bad:
<a href=https://www.w3schools.com/html/>Visit our HTML tutorial</a>
Example:
<p title=About W3Schools>

Single or Double Quotes?
Double quotes around attribute values are the most common in HTML, but single quotes can also be used.
In some situations, when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes:
Example:<p title='John "ShotGun" Nelson'></p>
vice versa
<p title="John 'ShotGun' Nelson"></p>
