<!--A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.
Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.
Semantic Elements in HTML
Many web sites contain HTML code like: <div id="nav"> <div class="header"> <div id="footer"> to indicate navigation, header, and footer.
In HTML there are some semantic elements that can be used to define different parts of a web page
<article>
<aside>
<details>
<figcaption>
<figure>
<footer>
<header>
<main>
<mark>
<nav>
<section>
<summary>

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <body>
    
    <section>
      <h1>WWF</h1>

    </section>
    
    </body>
    </html>

HTML <article> Element
The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content.
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <body>
    
    <h1>The article element</h1>
    
    <article>
      <h2>Google Chrome</h2>
      <p>Google Chrome is a web browser developed by Google, released in 2008. Chrome is the world's most popular web browser today!</p>
    </article>
    
    <article>
      <h2>Mozilla Firefox</h2>
      <p>Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser developed by Mozilla. Firefox has been the second most popular web browser since January, 2018.</p>

      <h2>Microsoft Edge</h2>
      <p>Microsoft Edge is a web browser developed by Microsoft, released in 2015. Microsoft Edge replaced Internet Explorer.</p>
    </article>
    
    </body>
    </html>

    Nesting <article> in <section> or Vice Versa?
        The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content.
        
        The <section> element defines section in a document.
        
        Can we use the definitions to decide how to nest those elements? No, we cannot!
        
        So, you will find HTML pages with <section> elements containing <article> elements, and <article> elements containing <section> elements.
