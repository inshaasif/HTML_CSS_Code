How To Add a Favicon in HTML
You can use any image you like as your favicon. You can also create your own favicon on sites like https://www.favicon.cc.
Next, add a <link> element to your "index.html" file, after the <title> element, like this:
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
      <title>My Page Title</title>
      <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/images/favicon.ico">
    </head>
    <body>
    
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    
    </body>
    </html>
