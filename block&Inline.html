Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.
There are two display values: block and inline.
A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.
The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.
The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <body>
    
    <p style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</p>
    <div style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</div>
    
    <p>The P and the DIV elements are both block elements, and they will always start on a new line and take up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).</p>
    
    </body>
    </html>

    <!--Here are the block-level elements in HTML:
<address><article><aside><blockquote><canvas><dd><div><dl><dt><fieldset><figcaption><figure><footer><form>
<h1>-<h6><header><hr><li><main><nav><noscript><ol><p><pre><section><table><tfoot><ul><video>-->

    Inline Elements
    An inline element does not start on a new line.
    An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
    This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.

        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <body>
        
        <p>This is an inline span <span style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</span> element inside a paragraph.</p>
        
        <p>The SPAN element is an inline element, and will not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.</p>
        
        </body>
        </html>

    <!--Here are the inline elements in HTML:
    <a><abbr><acronym><b><bdo><big><br><button><cite><code><dfn><em><i><img><input><kbd><label><map><object>
    <output><q><samp><script><select><small><span><strong><sub><sup><textarea><time><tt><var>-->
    
        The <div> Element
            The <div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.
            The <div> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
            When used together with CSS, the <div> element can be used to style blocks of content
                <!DOCTYPE html>
                <html>
                <body>
                
                <div style="background-color:black;color:white;padding:20px;">
                  <h2>London</h2>
                  <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement for two millennia, its history going back to its founding by the Romans, who named it Londinium.</p>
                </div> 
                
                </body>
                </html>

                The <span> Element
                    The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.
                    The <span> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
                    When used together with CSS, the <span> element can be used to style parts of the text
                        <!DOCTYPE html>
                        <html>
                        <body>

                            <h1>The span element</h1>

                            <p>My mother has <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">blue</span> eyes and my father has <span style="color:darkolivegreen;font-weight:bold;">dark green</span> eyes.</p>

                        </body>
                        </html>
