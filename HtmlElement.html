    HTML ELEMENT:
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>

Examples of some HTML elements:
<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

Nested Html element:

HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).
All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.
The following example contains four HTML elements (<html>, <body>, <h1> and <p>)

    The <html> element is the root element and it defines the whole HTML document.
    It has a start tag <html> and an end tag </html>.
    Then, inside the <html> element there is a <body> element
        The <body> element defines the document's body.
            It has a start tag <body> and an end tag </body>.    
            Then, inside the <body> element there are two other elements: <h1> and <p>
                The <h1> element defines a heading.
                    It has a start tag <h1> and an end tag </h1>
                    The <p> element defines a paragraph.
                        It has a start tag <p> and an end tag </p>:
                        
Empty HTML Elements:
HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.
The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag:
Example:<p>This is a <br> paragraph with a line break.</p>
