<img src="workplace.jpg" alt="Workplace" usemap="#workmap" width="400" height="379">

<map name="workmap">
  <area shape="rect" coords="34,44,270,350" alt="Computer" href="computer.htm">
  <area shape="rect" coords="290,172,333,250" alt="Phone" href="phone.htm">
  <area shape="circle" coords="337,300,44" alt="Cup of coffee" href="coffee.htm">

The Image:
The usemap value starts with a hash tag # followed by the name of the image map,
and is used to create a relationship between the image and the image map.

Create Image Map
Then, add a <map> element.
The <map> element is used to create an image map, and is linked to the image by using the required name attribute:
    <map name="workmap">
The name attribute must have the same value as the <img>'s usemap attribute 

The Areas
Then, add the clickable areas.
A clickable area is defined using an <area> element.

Shape
You must define the shape of the clickable area, and you can choose one of these values:
rect - defines a rectangular region
circle - defines a circular region
poly - defines a polygonal region
default - defines the entire region

Shape="poly"
The shape="poly" contains several coordinate points, which creates a shape formed with straight lines (a polygon).
This can be used to create any shape.
Like maybe a croissant shape!
